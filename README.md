When night falls, the fire is life. As the guardian of your tribe, you and your people must protect your sacred campfire from rival clans lurking in the shadows.
This was a game i made a long time ago for a Gamejam, and i finished recently, you can play it on itch.io

<h2>Dev Story</h2>
<p> I found a tribal caveman model on Sketch Fab which i really liked, so i worked on a game concept that uses this exact model. iam also a big fan of procedural generated worlds and survival concepts, so i made a game similar to Muck and Minecraft.</p>

<p> A key challenge that i had was to find more models for the game, i couldn't find any similar models to my main character model so i used Meshy AI tool to generate one, which turned out great, i have no modeling experience so that was really my only hope </p>

The enemy character is the first AI that i developed fully on my own, i added kalman filter, attacking, animated it using mixamo, made my own logic. It turned out to be a big bully character that throws stone on you and fights back. I like him.. he also has a pretty funny face, it was a model that i found on Sketchfab and whoever made it was on a rush.

<h2> Screenshots </h2>

Here are some screenshots of the game Day-night cycle and the procedural generated world, thought the game itself may have a different look as iam always updating it.
